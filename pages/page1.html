        <div class="overflow"> Items are deleted from one end of the queue, called the front, and new items are
            added to the other end, called the rear.
            In our application, we initialize a queue with the given state triple 008 and repeat
            the following steps until a desired state—a triple containing a 4—is encountered
            for the first time. For the state at the front of the queue, label all the new states
            reachable from it, add them to the queue, and then delete the front state from
            the queue. After the desired state is reached for the first time, follow the labels
            backward to get the shortest sequence of transformations that solve the puzzle.
            The application of this algorithm to the puzzle’s data yields the following</div>
